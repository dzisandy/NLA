SGNS embeds both words and their contexts into a low-dimensional space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, resulting in the word and context matrices $W$ and $C$. The rows of matrix $W$ are typically used in NLP tasks (such as computing word similarities) while $C$ is ignored. It is nonetheless instructive to consider the product $W^\\top C = M$. Viewed this way, SGNS can be described as factorizing an implicit matrix $M$ of dimensions $m \\times m$ into two smaller matrices.\n",

Thus, SGNS is factorizing a matrix in which each row corresponds to a word $w \\in \\mathcal{V}$ , each column corresponds to a context $c \\in \\mathcal{V}$, and each cell contains a quantity $f(w,c)$ reflecting the strength of association between that particular word-context pair. Such word-context association matrices are very common in the NLP and word-similarity literature. That said, the objective of SGNS does not explicitly state what this association metric is. What can we say about the association function $f(w,c)$? In other words, which matrix is SGNS factorizing? Below you will find the answers."

    "Download the dataset from [here](https://goo.gl/oZVxEa), unzip it and put `dblp_authors.npz`  and `dblp_graph.npz` in the same folder with this notebook. Each value (author name) from `dblp_authors.npz` corresponds to the row/column of the matrix from `dblp_graph.npz`. Value at row `i` and column `j` of the matrix from `dblp_graph.npz` corresponds to the number of times author `i` cited papers of the author `j`. Let us now find the most significant scientists according to PageRank model over DBLP data.\n",

    "* (4 pts) Load the weighted adjacency matrix and the authors list into Python using ```load_dblp(...)``` function. Print its density (fraction of nonzero elements). Find top-10 most cited authors from the weighted adjacency matrix. Now, make all the weights of the adjacency matrix equal to 1 for simplicity (consider only existence of connection between authors, not its weight). Obtain the PageRank matrix $A$ from the adjacency matrix and verify that it is stochastic.\n",
